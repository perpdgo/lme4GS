Description: Flexible functions that use 'lme4' as computational engine for 
             fitting the models.Genomic selection (GS) is a technology used for genetic 
             improvement, and it has many advantages over phenotype-based selection. There 
             are several statistical models that adequately approach the statistical 
             challenges in GS, such as in linear mixed models (LMMs). The 'lme4' is the 
             standard package for fitting linear and generalized LMMs in the R-package, 
             but its use for genetic analysis is limited because it does not allow the 
             correlation between individuals or groups of individuals to be defined. The 
             'lme4GS' package is focused on fitting LMMs with covariance structures defined 
             by the user, bandwidth selection, and genomic prediction. The new package is 
             focused on genomic prediction of the models used in GS and can fit LMMs using
             different variance-covariance matrices. Several examples of GS models are 
             presented using this package as well as the analysis using real data. For more
             details see Caamal-Pat et.al. (2021) <doi:10.3389/fgene.2021.680569>.
